  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?

* What new skills have you learned?

I learned how to use *p* tags to separate paragraphs without using `<br>`.

* What has been easy?

Using <p> tags to match the mockup was easy.

* What has been difficult?

Nothing

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

By solving the problem one paragraph at a time.
This helped me make sure I didn't miss any detail in the mockup.
